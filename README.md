# Airbnb Data Analysis

Airbnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. The company is based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via the website and mobile app. Airbnb's mission is to create a world where anyone can belong anywhere and the company focused on creating an end-to-end travel platform to handle every part of a consumer’s trip. This dataset contains approx 48895 observations with 16 columns and it is a mix of categorical and numeric values. Categorical variables in data are name, host_name, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room type, and last review. Numerical columns are id, host_id, latitude, longitude, price and availability_365. First, we cleaned the data through Dropping Unnecessary columns for data simplification, handled missing values and replaced the null values with zero.
